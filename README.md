Are you someone who is looking for better health? Then we are sure that this device would be helpful to monitor the quality of water. In
brief it displays about the Total Dissolved Solids content in the water,
which makes us know whether the water is fit for drinking or not.

SOLUTION:
TDS meter is a water quality analysis device used to indicate the total
dissolved solids in a solution (usually water). Since dissolved ionized
solids (such as salts and minerals) increase the conductivity of a
solution, a TDS meter can also measure the conductivity of a solution.
It improves the Quality of health by increasing the immunity in
humans as water plays a prominent role.In this project, we propose a
development and extension of a real time water eminence computing
structure at compact cost using Internet of Things (IoT). To figure out
the TDS value. The sensor output data is displayed on the screen.

COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. TDS Meter V1.0
3. TDS Sensor
4. LCD 16x2 with i2c module
5. Breadboard
6. Jumper wires
